# Jace Halvorson's Portfolio
This web application showcasing my experience as a software engineer was built with NodeJS/React, styled with CSS, and deployed with AWS Amplify (S3, API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB).

## Stat Huddle
A comprehensive NFL statistics application that provides extensive access to historical data from 1938 to the present day. Built on the React framework, this app delivers a highly responsive and user-friendly browsing experience for both casual viewers and sports analysts. The stats were acquired with a Rust-based web scraper, which extracted them from Pro Football Reference, converted them to JSON format, and securely stored them in an Amazon DynamoDB database.

In addition to the browser interface, Stat Huddle offers a REST API for developers, enabling integration with custom applications or further analysis of the provided data. This API gives developers access to data in the Amazon DynamoDB database, ensuring optimized loading speeds and performance for quick and reliable extraction. This streamlined setup allows users to access and analyze NFL statistics seamlessly, facilitating a comprehensive exploration of historical trends and player performance metrics.

REST API endpoint (adjust parameters for different stats): https://zs8qi2592b.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/main/nflstats/2022/passing

Stat Huddle offers a valuable resource for those seeking to gain insight into the world of NFL statistics and is designed to cater to various user preferences, from casual browsing to advanced statistical analysis.
